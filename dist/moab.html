                <h3>General Information</h3>
                <p>The tiny town of Antimony is located on UT-22 just 41 miles north of Bryce Canyon and five miles south of Otter Creek State Park. Once a booming mine town, this small community of 168 is now a bucolic ranching, vacation and leisure community nestled in the heart of Bryce Canyon Country. At an elevation of 6,500 feet, Antimony's distinct four seasons offer an abundance of outdoor recreation opportunities, from horseback riding to snowshoeing to year-round fishing. Best of all, Antimony gives visitors a chance to experience its Old West roots with high mountain trail rides, cattle drives, a working dude ranch, and sprawling, open spaces.</p>

                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>Antimony was originally settled in 1873 by 22 cattlemen on a peace-keeping mission with the Fish Lake Indians. It was first named Coyote, after a litter of pups they discovered nearby. In 1880 a Navajo Indian discovered antimony, an element useful for making bullets and arrowheads, in the canyons. Thanks to this discovery the town became a booming ranching and mining community, and in 1921 was renamed after the valuable mineral.</p>

                <h3>Things to Do</h3>
                <p>In and around Antimony there are plenty of prospects for camping, hiking, mountain biking, horseback riding, bird watching, river tubing, swimming, and fishing. Pristine Otter Creek State Park and Reservoir, just four miles north of Antimony on UT-22, is an oasis for fishing, boating, bird watching and ATV riding. The park has access to three ATV trails including the Paiute trail, and a campground with RV hookups and tent sites. Just south of Antimony, an unpaved turn-off leads to Antimony Creek, where you can fly fish for trout averaging 10-12 inches, in the shade of cottonwoods and willows. For a taste of history, go hiking in Antimony Canyon to see what's left of the once-thriving mine. A drive south on UT-22 through Black Canyon leads to the abandoned gristmill and creamery at the ghost town of Osiris. Thirteen miles further south near the junction of Nf-17, only a few abandoned log homes and a pioneer cemetery remain at the Widtsoe ghost town. Near Panguitch, mountain biking is popular among the red sandstone hoodoos of Casto Canyon, once a hideout for Butch Cassidy and his outlaw gang.</p>

                <p>Antimony is ideally situated in Bryce Canyon Country to reach many of Utah's state and national parks within a few hours. In less than an hour you can reach Bryce Canyon National Park, Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument, Fremont Indian State Park and Escalante Petrified Forest State Park. Anasazi Indian Village State Park, Capitol Reef National Park and Cedar Breaks National Monument are all within a 90-minute drive from Antimony. Zion National Park can be reached in about two hours, and Lake Powell's Bullfrog Marina is just three hours from Antimony.</p>

                <h3>Services</h3>
                <p>Services available year-round in Antimony include a guest ranch, campground, grocery and convenience store, a caf√© and gas.

                <h3>General Information</h3>

                <p>Boulder is a quiet farming community located at the junction of the Burr Trail and Scenic Highway 12. Nestled at the base of Boulder Mountain, Boulder is surrounded by the Dixie National Forest to the north and west, and Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument to the east. With lodging, dining, guides and outfitters ready to accommodate visitors, Boulder is a great base of operations for exploring scenic Bryce Canyon Country.</p>

                <p>Boulder is located on Scenic Highway 12, rated one of the ten most scenic highways by Car and Driver magazine. Amazing Bryce Canyon National Park is just to the south on Highway 12. Other nearby attractions include such wonderful places as Kodachrome Basin State Park, Cedar Breaks National Monument, Zion National Park, Capitol Reef National Park and Dixie National Forest are all located nearby.</p>

                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>Between 1050 and 1275 A.D. the Boulder area was home to one of the largest Anasazi Indian communities in the region. Hopi and Paiute Indians briefly occupied the region in the following centuries. The remote community of Boulder was settled in 1889 by two ranchers who brought a large herd of cattle to graze on Boulder Mountain. Surrounded by mountains and public lands, Boulder remained isolated until the U.S. Civilian Conservation Corps, a public work relief program for young men during the Great Depression, built a road in 1935. Accordingly, Boulder was the last town in the United States to receive its mail by mule train. Boulder was officially incorporated in 1958. Three decades later the northern portion of Scenic Byway 12 was paved over Boulder Mountain, opening up this rural community to tourism.</p>

                <h3>Grand Staircase ArchState Parks</h3>
                <p>Anasazi State Park was established in 1970 to preserve the relics and history of Boulder's earliest inhabitants. Much of the village remains unexcavated but many artifacts are on display in the park's museum. Escalante Petrified Forest State Park and Kodachrome Basin State Park near Bryce Canyon are also within easy driving distance of Boulder.</p>

                <h3>National Parks/Monuments</h3>
                <p>Boulder is within half a day's drive from Bryce Canyon National Park (77 miles west), Capitol Reef National Park (46 miles northeast), and Zion National Park (158 miles southwest). Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument is on the southern border of Boulder, and Glen Canyon National Recreation Area/Lake Powell is just 75 miles southeast of Boulder to Bullfrog Basin.</p>

                <h3>Scenic Drives</h3>
                <p>Scenic Byway 12, Utah's first All-American Road, offers amazing sights within easy reach of Boulder. Head north on Scenic Byway 12 from Boulder to high-elevation fishing on Boulder Mountain. Head in the opposite direction toward Bryce Canyon for access to the Hogback, Escalante Canyon and Bryce Valley or spur roads that lead to Hole-in-the-Rock Road, Hell's Backbone and Posey Lake. A drive east on the 66-mile Burr Trail passes through Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument, Capitol Reef National Park, and the Henry Mountains to Ticaboo and the shores of Lake Powell.</p>

                <h3>Events</h3>
                <p>The Boulder Heritage Festival celebrates Boulder's history, from its ancient residents to its pioneer settlers. The festival is held each July and features arts, crafts, music and stories.</p>

                <h3>Lodging, Dining and Amenities</h3>
                <p>With half a dozen motels and campgrounds in Boulder, you'll find a variety of accommodations from yurt and teepees at the Coyote Hors Du Temps to luxury guest rooms at the Boulder Mountain Lodge. A variety of restaurants are open seasonally. The Hills and Hollows General Store is open year round, providing groceries, fresh sandwiches, handmade pizzas and homemade bakery treats, plus gifts, gas and camping supplies. Local outfitters can assist visitors with everything from guided day hikes to llama pack trips.</p>

                <h3>General Information</h3>

                <p>Cannonville joins with Tropic and Henrieville to make up the colorful and scenic Bryce Valley. The tiny ranching community of 150 was settled in the early 1880s by Mormon pioneers and was named for a prominent church official. Cannonville lies along Scenic Byway 12, surrounded by Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument and bordering Red Canyon in Dixie National Forest. It's just a short drive to both Bryce Canyon National Park and Kodachrome Basin State Park from Cannonville, making it an ideal place to stay while exploring this striking region.</p>

                <h3>Drives</h3>
                <p>A 15-mile drive west on Scenic Byway 12, Utah's first All-American Road, leads to the intriguing hoodoos and sweeping vistas of Bryce Canyon National Park.

A drive further south along Cottonwood Canyon Road, which cuts through rugged Cottonwood Canyon, leads to other geologic wonders located within the borders of Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument such as Cottonwood Wash Narrows and Grosvenor Arch. Information about attractions within the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument can be found at the Cannonville Visitor Center, located on Center Street. The visitor center also presents an in-depth look at the area's human history.</p>

                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>Escalante was named for Franciscan missionary Silvestre Velez de Escalante, whopassed through the region in 1776 during an expedition from Santa Fe, NM to Monterey, CA. The remote community was settled in 1876 by Mormon pioneers from nearby Panguitch. They designed the town on a grid system, dividing the land into equitable five-acre blocks. Each family in this farming and ranching community was also provided with 20 acres of farmland outside of town. Today, this charming town of 800, called 'Escalant' by locals, is home to a diverse population of ranchers, farmers, artists and outdoor enthusiasts.</p>

                <h3>Area Attractions and Activities</h3>
                <p>There's no shortage of things to do in and around Escalante, from hiking, biking and horseback riding in the spectacular canyons and backcountry, to visiting rustic pioneer homes, unique shops and galleries.

Close to an amazingly beautiful river. You can hike, fish or just meditate there. The night sky is amazing too. The tap water is some of the cleanest, finest in the US. A back porch is ideal for sitting out and enjoying the evening after a long day exploring or with your morning coffee. Deer and wildlife are not scarce around here.

                <h3>General Information</h3>

                <p>The quaint town of Hatch is located 15 miles south of Panguitch and 24 miles southwest of Bryce Canyon National Park on US-89. The first town site, originally called Aaron or Asay, was established in 1872 near the mouth of Asay Creek. When flooding forced the community's founding families to move they joined others settled along the Sevier River and created Hatchtown. After more severe flooding and the breaking of the reservoir, the town was again moved to its present site and named Hatch after one of its founding members. Hatch was incorporated in 1934, and currently has a population of 130 people.</p>

                <p>Located at the junction of Mammoth Creek and the Sevier River, Hatch offers excellent fishing. Mammoth and Asay Creeks, the headwaters of the Sevier River, are stocked with rainbow, German brown and cutthroat trout. The Sevier River is also well-stocked, and the area around Hatch offers some of the best fishing on the river.</p>

                <p>The Mammoth Creek Fish Hatchery is located just a few miles southwest of Hatch. The hatchery is responsible for stocking catchable rainbow trout in area waters. The facility is currently closed to tours but kiosks in the parking lot explain how the fish hatchery operates. West of Hatch, Mammoth Cave is one of the largest lava tubes in Utah with more than 2,200 feet of passage and four chambers. The quarter-mile cave was formed by cooling lava and flowing water about 2,000 years ago‚Äîrelatively young in geologic terms. Part of the Markagunt Plateau in Dixie National Forest, Mammoth Caves is located at an elevation of 8,050 feet, so it stays cool year round and offers unobstructed stargazing. Sections of the cave or Mammoth Creek Road may be closed from October through June due to snowfall. There are several ATV and snowmobile trails around Mammoth Cave, including the 19-mile roundtrip Mammoth Cave Loop Trail that begins in Hatch. There are also several trails in Red Canyon, north of Hatch at the junction of US-89 and Scenic Byway 12. A 5.5-mile hiking/biking/horse trail leads from Red Canyon to Casto Canyon, a famous outlaw hideout between Panguitch and Hatch. From Hatch, Bryce Canyon National Park is just a 30-minute drive down Scenic Byway 12. Bryce Canyon National Park is an easy day trip from Hatch, whether you choose to do a few short hikes or simply drive the scenic route through Bryce Canyon.</p>

                <h3>Services</h3>
                <p>The visitor center just south of Hatch on US-89 is a logical first stop for information about area attractions. Hatch also has restaurants, lodging, a convenience store and post office. The Daughters of Utah Pioneer Museum is open by appointment. The Forest Service Visitor Center is open seasonally.</p>

                <h3>Lodging and Dining</h3>
                <p>Accommodations in Hatch include several motels and campgrounds/RV parks. From rustic mountain cabins and Harley Davidson-themed rooms to more traditional quarters, there is plenty of affordable lodging in Hatch. Campers will wake up to incredible red rock views at any of Hatch's campgrounds.</p>

                <p>A variety of dining options can be found in Hatch, from the 50s-style Galaxy Diner to western hospitality with a river view at the Cactus Cowboy Restaurant and specialty sandwiches at Caf√© Adobe. Most restaurants in Hatch are open seasonally so plan accordingly. Mammoth and Asay Creeks are the headwaters of the Sevier River. The creeks are stocked with rainbow, German brown and cutthroat trout and offer excellent fishing, but check locally because some of the streams run through private land. The Sevier River is also stocked and the area around Hatch has the best fishing on the river. The Sevier River runs north and suddenly disappears for miles then reappears to fill reservoirs like Piute Reservoir.</p>

From comfortable rooms to towering red canyon and sand ATV trails, delicious food and hidden coves on Lake Powell, the Ticaboo Experience is about leaving the normal behind and experiencing the spectacular.

                <h3>General Information</h3>

                <p>Panguitch lies in the heart of Bryce Canyon Country, immersed in history, scenery and boundless outdoor recreation opportunities. Known as 'The Center of Scenic Utah,' Panguitch is surrounded by Dixie National Forest to the east and west and is located just 26 miles northwest of Bryce Canyon National Park. At an elevation of 6,700 feet, Panguitch's verdant spring, mild summer climate, brilliant fall colors and snowy winters makes it pleasant to hike, mountain bike, ATV ride, snowmobile, cross country ski, horseback ride, fish and more. A stroll through the Panguitch Historic District, placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006, reveals charming red brick buildings, plus unique shops, restaurants and a museum. In a place like Panguitch you simply won't run out of things to do.</p>

                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>Mormon pioneers settled the area in 1864. They adopted the name Panguitch, meaning 'big fish,' from the Paiute Indian word for the large fish they caught in nearby Panguitch Lake. Following a bitter fall when crops froze before the harvest, the new settlement faced starvation. Seven volunteers braved the harsh mountains in search of flour to keep the town's residents from starving, laying down a path of quilts to keep from falling in the snow. Today the annual Quilt Walk Festival commemorates this courageous journey. Panguitch was abandoned in 1866 during the Black Hawk Indian War but determined pioneers resettled the town in 1871.</p>

                <h3>General Information</h3>

                <p>Tropic is located along Scenic Highway 12, just 11 miles from the east entrance to Bryce Canyon National Park. Settled in 1891 by pioneers from nearby Panguitch, Tropic was named to reflect its hot summer climate. Despite its name, this tenacious community survived a severe blizzard that dumped three feet of snow on the farmlands in May of 1900. Harsh winters followed by drought and overgrazing led President Roosevelt to create reserves to protect local forests and watersheds. Today Tropic is a thriving ranching community with a population of about 500, and serves as an excellent home base for exploring beautiful Bryce Canyon Country. Tropic, Cannonville and Henrieville join via Scenic Highway 12 to make up colorful Bryce Valley. From the dazzling sunrises that wash over the striking hoodoos in Bryce Canyon to the vibrant sunset that turns Powell Point and the Escalante Mountains brilliant shades of pink and orange, there's no place like Bryce Valley.</p>
