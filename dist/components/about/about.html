                    <p class="leader-name">Adam Stoker</p>
                    <p class="leader-about">Adam was born in Oklahoma and has lived in several states across the country including Utah, Alabama, North Carolina, Georgia and Alaska. (Luckily, he doesn't say "y'all" anymore.) Adam has been working in advertising since 2007. He graduated from Brigham Young University's prestigious advertising program. After excelling in school, Adam left the small agency where he was employed to take a chance on an internship at a larger agency in Farmington, Utah. There he was able to work on several important accounts including Ken Garff Automotive Group, Lagoon, Tai Pan Trading, Stephen's Hot Cocoa and many more. <br>

                      <br>  Because of his opportunistic personality, Adam jumped at the offer to move to St. George and join Relic in 2011. He currently manages Baja Broadband, Brian Head Resort, Cedar City/Brian Head Tourism Bureau, Jack Fisher Homes, USA Communications, and Utah Shakespeare Festival. If you need help with your marketing plan or advertising campaign, Adam is the man to call.</p>

                    <p class="leader-about">Jordan has been in the digital advertising industry for close to ten years where he has built the digital revenue engines for some of Utah's most promising companies. His work has driven results for brands like Walgreens, Pfizer, Bayer, The University of Phoenix, Pluralsight, and Microsoft to name a few. He is an accomplished marketing expert, and recognized leader in customer acquisition and demand generation. <br><br>

                        As Chief Digital Officer, Jordan is responsible for all aspects of digital marketing at Relic Agency including customer acquisition and demand generation, lifecycle marketing, testing and optimization, as well as reporting and analytics.   <br><br>

                        When Jordan isn't dissecting data, he enjoys spending time with his wife and two children. He enjoys playing tennis and basketball, although he admittedly isn't very good at either.</p>

He and his wife Crystal are the happy and tired parents of three strapping young boys and a beautiful daughter who would love nothing more than to reside in Disneyland.<br><br>

                        Among these extra-curricular endeavors, Colby is the very definition of a sound, creative mind. He has been professionally employed in the industry since 2007, joining Relic Agency in June 2011, and is a graduate of Brigham Young University's prestigious advertising program and creative track where he was an award-winning art director.<br><br>

                        He has been successful in developing creative strategy for numerous campaigns for a variety of clients including TDS, Dixie State University, Garfield County Tourism, Tuacahn Amphitheatre, Utah Valley Parade of Homes and Ruby's Inn.</p><br><br>
